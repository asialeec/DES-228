            <p>
            I was born and raised in sunny San Diego, and I'm a multimedia design specialist
        and aspiring creative director. Growing up, my passion has always been creating and visual
        storytelling—from my childhood scribbles. Ever since I was a kid, I've been naturally attracted to beauty and aesthetics. 
        I loved making things that were visually pleasing and emotionally captivating. I've been artistic since I came out the womb and creativity kind of runs in my family. 
        We weren't artists, but we had a natural creative talent that was undeniable. However, I didn't even consider pursuing a career as an 
        artist/designer until I got to high school. 
        <br>
        <br>
            I attended Kearny High School, which had four different academies, each with its own concentration.
        I ended up in the School of Digital Media and Design, though it wasn't my first choice. In fact, I didn't choose it at all. 
        I wanted to attend the School of International Business and thought I was going to be a biologist or veterinarian. 
        However, after four years of filming, editing, producing products for major clientele, and shooting sport photography, 
        I realized my true passion and artistic purpose. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Creating became my purpose and I found constant inspiration in everything I made.
        I was so invested to the point where I even considered attending the Pratt Institute for college. 
        My love for art stemmed from the beauty of it, and eventually I couldn't stop seeing it in everything.  
        Naturally, all these experiences guided me to pursuing a career in design! I'm now studying at 
        San Francisco State, preparing to wrap up this chapter with a bachelor's degree in Visual Communications Design. 
        With a love for all things design—visual, interior, fashion, and more
        —I'm eager to contribute to the industry, embrace its diversity, and learn from every opportunity that comes my way!</p>
